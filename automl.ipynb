    "Le code est brut. Je ne l'ai pas commenté ou quoi que ce soit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Le plus intéressant, c'est le contexte qui m'a permis de parvenir à cela : j'ai d'abord utilisé une library qui m'a permis de tester plusieurs modèle de manière automatique (pratique pour gagner du temps). Cette library est la suivante : https://mljar.com/automl/\n",
    "\n",
    "Ce n'est pas la seule, il en existe bien d'autre. Il est aussi aisé de créer sa propre lib pour tester des modèles et faire un rapport pour chaque modèles (ça peut être un bon exercice pour progresser sur le code et la connaissance des modèles !).\n",
    "\n",
    "Je n'ai pas réussi à faire tourner les tests en entier, mais cela m'a suffit pour voir que Catboost (https://catboost.ai/en/docs/) était un bon candidat pour obtenir un score d'average precision score élevé.\n",
    "\n",
    "J'ai donc effectué une simple baseline : c'est-à-dire que je prends le modèle avec les paramètres par défaut (j'ai juste ajusté la loss pour qu'elle corresponde à la problématique), et j'ai gardé les données telles qu'elles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avec un peu de chance, il s'est avéré que cette simple baseline était la bonne. Catboost sur-performe !\n",
    "\n",
    "Voilà ma démarche. C'est une démarche souvent employé dans le cadre de compétition de data-science. Cependant, on ne s'arrête pas simplement là. Il s'ensuit plusieurs itérations sur la recherche d'hyper-paramètres du modèle et de feature engineering. C'est d'ailleurs souvent cette dernière qui fait la différence dans le top du classement."
